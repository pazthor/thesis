\chapter{Introduction}

Micro-optimization is a technique to reduce the overall operation count of
floating point operations.  In a standard floating point unit, floating
point operations are fairly high level, such as ``multiply'' and ``add'';
in a micro floating point unit ($\mu$FPU), these have been broken down into
their constituent low-level floating point operations on the mantissas and
exponents of the floating point numbers.
